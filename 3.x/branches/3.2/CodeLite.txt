Once created files:

- Settings -> Environment Variables: create a new set (mine is called wx291) and add something like:

	291Release=/path/to/local/wx291/buildgtk
	291Debug=/path/to/local/wx291/buildgtkd

- Settings -> Tags Settings -> Include Files tab: remove system installed wx include path if any
