Bitmap property known bugs
--------------------------

Both versions:

- Using 'Load From Embedded Files', image is saved after CPP panel selection (not when in designer).

- Weird behaviours when changing image source type in CPP panel (wrong properties and repeted calls to Typeconv::ParseBitmapWithResource (2 times, maybe because cpp and h notebook pages).

Old version only:

- Art Provider icons have same size regardless Art Client ID in use.

- Switching from a different source, the previous child value is not resetted
  (e.g. Load From Art Provider -> Load From File -> file_path == wxART_XXX).

New Version only:

- Due to new wxPropertyGrid version limitation, the index of the image filter in the wxFileDialog
  can't be set in code
  (it keeps only the last used next time the user load another bitmap).
