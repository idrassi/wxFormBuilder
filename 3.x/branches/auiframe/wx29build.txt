MacOSX / Linux / BSD ( wxGTK )
-----
- Checkout from wxWidgets SVN trunk version in some path (something like ~/Dev/wx29x/ )

- Use the way to compile it like described in wxWidgets docs/gtk/install.txt without make install command (local build)

- Execute build/premake4/create_build_files.sh from a terminal

Codelite:
- Open build/codelite/wxFormBuilder.workspace

- Go to Settings -> Environment Variables: create a new set (or use Default one) and add something like:

    29xRelease=~/Dev/wx29x/buildgtk
    29xDebug=~/Dev/wx29x/buildgtkd

- Go to Workspace menu -> Workspace Settings... -> Code Completion -> Search Paths and add a search path that will looks like:

    path/to/wx29x/include 

    so CodeLite will find correct include files instead those installed in your system (if any) for code completion

Windows ( wxMSW )
