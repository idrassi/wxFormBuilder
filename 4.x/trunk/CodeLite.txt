Linux ( wxGTK )
-----
- Checkout from wxWidgets svn trunk version in some path (something like ~/Dev/wx29x/ )

- Use the way to compile it like described in wxWidgets docs/gtk/install.txt without make install command (local build)

- Execute create_build_files.sh from a terminal and than open wxFormBuilder.workspace

- Right click on wxFormBuilder project and 'Set As Active' project

- Go to Settings -> Environment Variables: create a new set (or use Default one) and add something like:

	29xRelease=~/Dev/wx29x/buildgtk
	29xDebug=~/Dev/wx29x/buildgtkd

- Go to Workspace menu -> Workspace Settings... -> Parser Include Files and add a search path that will looks like:

	path/to/wx29x/include

	so CodeLite will find correct files instead those installed in your system (if any)

Windows ( wxMSW )
