wxFormBuilder 4
requires: wxWidgets 2.9+

LINUX
-----
Build & Install
 (here for Ubuntu but others are similar) 
> mkdir build; cd build
> cmake ..
> make
> sudo make install

If you need more control or want to change setting use "ccmake" or "cmake-gui" instead of cmake.

Dev's:
- for better debugging set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to "Debug" to include debug informations
- you may also set wxFB_DEBUG=ON to add extra wxformbuilder Debug stuff
- if you have multiple wxWidget-Libs installed you may set 'wxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE' to the corresponding wx-config
Commandline example: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DwxFB_DEBUG=ON -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=~/wx2-9 ..

// IN CHANGE:
//- binaries are written to 'output' directory 
//  this may require some additional steps in you IDE
//  for example in eclipse: 
//    debug-configuration: Application: output/bin/wxformbuilder
- CMake is integrated into the resulting makefiles.
  So you only have to run CMake again if you want to change the build-options.
- use 'make DOC' to build source documentation (doxygen required)



Windows
-------
Run "cmake-gui" and choose source code directory.
For build directory add an additional /build (too keep main source clean)
On the first run cmake will prompt you to choose an IDE.
CMake doesn't support to build 32bit & 64bit solutions add once.
So you might have too choose which version you want.
Note: Binaries are written to 'output' directory.

Visual-Studio
-------------
Open the "wx_FB" solution from you build-folder.
VS2010: Because of a bug in CMAKE you have to manually disable manifest generation in wxFormBuilder.
        (properties->Linker->Manifestfile->Generate Manifest)
When CMake files are modified VS will auto regenerate the solution on build.
You may have to reload project/solution. This is usally detected by VS or by the VS-CMake addin.
For Debug-Runs you should set "wxFormBuilder" as start project and set Workingdirectory to "${TargetDir}".

The special projects in the solution:
- 'DOC' will generate source-code documentation in docs/html/index.htm
  (requires Doxygen; after doxygen installation you have to (re-)run cmake)
- 'INSTALL' will copy all files to standard installtion path.  ( like c:/Program files/wxformbuilder )
  Usually you only need that for final testing.
- 'ZERO_CHECK' this is internal only - to check cmake files and update solution
